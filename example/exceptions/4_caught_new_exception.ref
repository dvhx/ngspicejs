Calling 100x "throw new Exception(string)" in try/catch block:
Program continues (but the stack trace was generated in the background, it took 0.3s)

To suppress it, you must set Exception.fast = true;
Program continues (and the stack trace was NOT generated, it took 10ms)

Or you use throw "string":
Program continues (string exceptions do not generate stack trace, it took 11ms)
